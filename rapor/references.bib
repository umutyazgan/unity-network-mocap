    Abstract = {This paper presents a multi-camera motion capture system aiming to provide
    caregivers with timely access to the patient's health status through mobile communication
    devices. The major components include video capture, object detection, video coding and
    transmission, error concealment, and video analysis. Our contribution is twofold. First,
    several novel ideas are developed, including fast object detection, and content-aware and
    adaptive video coding and transmission. Second, all components are seamlessly integrated in a
    unified optimization framework dedicated for online data transmission. In the scenario, the
    subject walked on a treadmill with four tripod cameras capturing the video from different
    viewpoints. After video compression and transmission over a wireless sensor network, the remote
    receiver recovered the videos and performed multi-view motion capture for gait analysis.
    Experimental results show that the presented system design achieves better video quality than
    traditional },

    Abstract = {Many people suffer from a brain injury that requires rehabilitation. Rehabilitation
    might be exhausting and difficult. Therefore, it is necessary to develop mechanisms to engage
    the patients, e.g. a videogame. We propose the design of an immersive videogame that integrates
    motion capture, electromyography (EMG) sensing and Virtual Reality (VR) in one unique system
    using Unity engine and the design of EMG sensors. The system has as user inputs the motion
    capture system given by Microsoft Kinect or Yei 3-Space Sensors, and the measured effort in the
    muscle (biceps). The output is the control of a videogame sequence using for the visualization
    the Oculus Rift. We tested the system with 120 healthy subjects, where 94% of them were able to
    control their muscle's signal.},

    Abstract = {In this paper, a new dance training system based on the motion capture and virtual
    reality (VR) technologies is proposed. Our system is inspired by the traditional way to learn
    new movements-imitating the teacher's movements and listening to the teacher's feedback. A
    prototype of our proposed system is implemented, in which a student can imitate the motion
    demonstrated by a virtual teacher projected on the wall screen. Meanwhile, the student's
    motions will be captured and analyzed by the system based on which feedback is given back to
    them. The result of user studies showed that our system can successfully guide students to
    improve their skills. The subjects agreed that the system is interesting and can motivate them
    to learn.},
